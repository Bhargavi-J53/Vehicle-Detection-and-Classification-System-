# Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification-System-
This project is a Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Toll Management System using YOLOv5 for accurate detection and DeepSORT for tracking. Vehicles are classified (cars, trucks, bikes) and tolls are dynamically calculated. The system runs in real time, reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and improving toll plaza efficiency.
